Biblatex-japanese
=================

This package WILL provide a framework to use the [biblatex package](https://github.com/plk/biblatex) for bibliographies in Japanese articles and books.
The development of the package has been just started; the package is not practical at present.

The details are explained in doc/biblatex-japanese.pdf (now only available in Japanese).
